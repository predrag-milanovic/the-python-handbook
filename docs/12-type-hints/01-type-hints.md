# Type Hints

Some functions accept [numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) as arguments; others accept [strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str). Some return [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range); others return [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict), [booleans](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-type-bool), or [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#none).

When a program is small, you can usually remember the types of your variables. But as programs grow, it becomes easier to forget:

- Is `level` an `int` or a `str`?
- Does `get_item()` always return an item name (`str`), or sometimes `None` if it cannot find one?
- Is `inventory` a list of strings, or a dictionary of item counts?

[Type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) let us write those expectations directly in our code:

```python
def get_damage(weapon: dict, level: int) -> int:
    return weapon["damage"] + (level * 2)
```

The `weapon: dict`, `level: int`, and `-> int` parts are type hints. They tell humans and code editors what kinds of values the function expects and returns.

Type hints do not make Python stop being Python. It is still a [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information) language, and it will not automatically reject the wrong value just because a type hint says so.

Type hints are useful for:

- Making code easier to read
- Helping your editor autocomplete and warn you about mistakes
- Making bugs easier to spot before running your code
